# 5.1 Code Along and Code it Solo - Input Fields and .value
## TikTok Comments Section

### Code Along:

1. Update the `myUsername` variable in `script.js` with your username!

2. Create an input field in the HTML on line 53 with a class and placeholder value. 

3. Inside of the click handler on line 20, create a new variable and use `.value` to store the input data in the variable

4. Use the console to check if the correct data is saved in the variable. Type something and click the button to confirm it works!

5. Use `.innerhtml()` to display the input value in the `your-comment-one` paragraph tag (Sneak preview of Lesson 5.4!).

6. Type something into the comment box and click the button to check if your input data correctly posts to the `your-comment-one` paragraph tag.

### Code it Solo:

1. Do what we did in the Code Along for the second video!

2. If you're feeling extra crazy... Try making the "like" button click-able and change the color to red when it's clicked!
